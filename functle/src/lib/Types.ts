 * Points use the same transform that draws the axes and ticks, so a point
 * with x = 0 sits exactly on the vertical axis and a point with y = 0 sits
 * exactly on the horizontal axis. The first value is plotted at x = 0, and
 * each subsequent value is spaced `xDelta` graph units further along the
 * x-axis. Y values map directly with no vertical shift, so the curve keeps
 * its proportions; the first point coincides with the graph origin only when
 * the first value is 0.
 *
 * @param values Function values, in left-to-right order.
 * @param xDelta Change in x between consecutive values, in graph units.
 * @returns One canvas pixel point per value.
